JavaScript: Sorting Algorithms

In this project I was able to observe that a problem can be solved with different algorithms, for example, a sorting problem solved with Selection Sort or Insertion Sort;
That, despite the end result being the same, the process (or logical steps) of each of the algorithms is different;
Creating functions for better code reuse, such as making Insertion Sort receive a list of different products;
Practicing more with table tests and seeing the code working step by step, and how this can help us better understand how the code of an algorithm works
